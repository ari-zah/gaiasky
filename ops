These strings are:\n1. \"Clear ruler\" from the drop-down menu (already included in the gsbundle  files but it's translation is not applied).\n2. \"Manual download\" from the \"Dataset manager\" (already included in the gsbundle files but it's translation is not applied).\n3. \"+Info\" and \"Archive\" buttons from the object information panel.\n4. \"Show hidden\" and \"Accepted (formats)\" text from the load dialogues.\n5. The heads up text which shows the date, time, focus, closest and home.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThese strings should be translatable in the \"gsbundle_xx_XX.properties\" files.\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - Gaia Sky version [3.0.3]\n\nRegards,\nGeorgi","files":null}]}
