The problem is that the `deb` package depends on `default-jre`, which [points to `openjdk-8-jre` in Debian](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/default-jre). I'll submit a patch to make it depend on `openjdk-11-jre`, but the change won't be effective until new packages are generated for the next version.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1566203732,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"205013168"},"status":2},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"8a423ea3e3d353afda04be598780d2b70b5b8de3"},"timestamp":1566205392,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"205032575"},"message":"In debian sid, `default-jre` points to `openjdk-11-jre` but I had a bunch of other versions installed that were used instead.
