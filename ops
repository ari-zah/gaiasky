I don't see a way to change which star is targeted though. As the right knob currently duplicates zooming movements I'll suggest binding that to a track mouse type movement of the cursor. A seems bound to a duplicate control and is usually affirm on xbox, so I'd say select object with A, then back to track mode with B or movement of the right axis knob.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1508913284,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"76472256"},"message":"Yes, selection is not supported in controllers so far.

I'll whip up a mappings file pull request.\n\nFor your information, I have a hand tracker that supports gesture controls. When I'm done this, I'll start on getting that mapped.\n\nProbably have to use other open source libraries for it, so it's a *future* thing, but yeah.
