The problem is that the library `sdl2gdx` that we use to interface with SDL controllers depends on `gdx-controllers:1.9.9`. I had to do some build gymnastics to temporarily patch it up in Gaia Sky, and additionally created a [merge request](https://github.com/electronstudio/sdl2gdx/pull/27) in order to update the library to the newer `2.0.0`. Hopefully they merge at some point.\n\nBottom line, here is a new package which hopefully fixes the \"Not responding\" Windows issues: [gaiasky_windows-x64_3_0_1_13b035aff.exe](https://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/gaiasky/files/temp/345/gaiasky_windows-x64_3_0_1_13b035aff.exe)\n\n*Edit:* apparently, `gdx-controllers:2.0.0` is already based on SDL2 through an older version of Jamepad. They opted not to use `gdx2sdl` due to licensing issues. I removed `gdx2sdl` entirely and everything seems to work just fine.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"fd2da513d113c60222ca119925129b84fc03df2f"},"timestamp":1610139780,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"481354793"},"message":"@langurmonkey This seems to work.
