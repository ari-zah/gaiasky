However, it would be good to be able to colour e.g. the stars in a stellar stream, in a cluster of in a certain region of the Milky Way by a property like metallicity or age. \n\nMaybe a colour bar could be chosen to colour the property linearly of logarithmically between two given cut values (e.g. having young stars in blue, medium old stars in green and old stars in red).\n\nThe property would be an additional column in the table used for the data set.","files":null}]}
