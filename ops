Restarted and got to earth-and-sky image with control panel, but after about 30 secs crashed. Read docs here (https://zah.uni-heidelberg.de/?id=660) where it suggested deleting $HOME/.gaiasky/global.properties and C:\\Users\\$username.gaiasky. Did so, restarted, crashed before any display.  Rebooted, Gaia crashed on startup, no display. Reinstalled, Gaia crashed on startup, no display.\n\nAny help appreciated.  I'm running on a high end PC with NVIDIA GTX 980 Ti with Vive VR hardware. Looking forward to trying your system out.","files":null}]}
