In my opinion it is related to the rendering speed. The star should immediately turn in to a 3D model instead of doing a wobbling 2D-\u003e3D transition.\n\nWhat you see on the third picture is basically my problem.\n1. I see a large point of light which wobbles at first and then suddenly it becomes a small 3D model.\n2. After that everything is normal until I reach a specific distance from the star with the camera again (around 2 AU).\n\nNB: This problem is distance specific, it doesn't happen randomly","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1611649630,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"493906497"},"message":"Yep, can confirm this was a bug introduced in 40b99a2.

Moving the camera shouldn't really affect performance, especially with non-LOD catalogs. Maybe you could try and activate safe mode, which disables some fancy backbuffer formats (should be faster) and defaults to OpenGL 3.2.

The safe mode provided around 1 FPS gain depending on the situation.\n\nThis is what I observed (with HIP and GAIA standard catalogues) and looks like the memory usage is the main bottleneck of Gaia Sky:\n\n1. With HIP I got a stable 75 FPS (74-75 without the safe mode) all the time, the memory usage goes up and down from 200 MB to 800 MB. I did not experience a single slow down but I don't know why it fluctates so much.\n2. With GAIA standard I got a stable 37 FPS (36-37 without safe mode) (90 degrees draw distance with smooth transitions enabled) with a noticeable increase in the ms time (13 ms vs 26 ms) and with a very large memory footprint of about 2200 MB (the limit probably).

Notice that with Hipparcos, you have 118K stars loaded and on display. With Gaia, you have 5 million stars loaded, and 2 million on display. That is an order of magnitude more stars.\n\n\u003e a very large memory footprint of about 2200 MB (the limit probably)\n\nNot even close to the limit actually. The maximum heap space is set to 6 GB (`total`). What's happening here is that the 2.2 GB (`used`) is very close to the currently allocated heap memory space (`alloc`). If Gaia Sky needs more, it will allocate more, to a maximum of 6 GB. In the extreme case that 6 GB is not enough, it will crash with an `OutOfMemoryError`. That is unlikely, but might happen with the larger catalogs and depending on the LOD settings. There are ways to set the maximum heap space even higher.\n\n\u003e The Milky Way is around 12-25 FPS with either GAIA standard or HIP\n\nYep, the Galaxy model is known to be hard on the GPU, but it is actually quite scientifically accurate.
