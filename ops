Flatpak is a new way to distribute apps on Linux that are generally confined - it's also the main way to get apps to Fedora SilverBlue and EndlessOS (education focused) users.  Flathub is a public repo that hosts a bunch of flatpaks.\n\nI hope to eventually be able to make a PR that adds Flatpak support, but generally Flathub wants it to be more direct line to the developers.  \n\nAny interest? Thanks!\n\nFlatpak intro: https://flatpak.org/\nFlathub (and app instructions): https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/App-Submission\nLikely openjdk to use: https://github.com/flathub/org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.openjdk11\nExample Jave app: https://github.com/flathub/org.eclipse.Java\n\nI believe the app id would be de.uni-heidelberg.zah.GaiaSky","files":null}]}
