It only supports OpenGL 3.x (Gaia Sky falls back to that version correctly, disabling tessellation), and this GPU seems to be more strict than usual in the treatment of varyings. Funny thing is that the crash happens because Gaia Sky tries to use a tessellation shader (compile failed), which should be disabled.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1579508286,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"273815865"},"message":"I can't reproduce the code path your instance is supposedly taking.
