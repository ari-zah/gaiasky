Points are basically always in the gpu memory. Quads are sent there every frame and are updated from the CPU. These two approaches make it difficult to manage the 3D displacements/rotations due to the two cameras correctly.\n \n3D mode uses now the approach of updating the scene once and rendering twice.\nThis presents problems with large eye separations, due to the camera being floated, namely:\n\n-  They run into float precision jittering\n-  Misdetections in LOD\n \nTo fix this we need to either get rid completely of primitives (points, lines, etc.) and use only triangle based rendering or do a two step approach where we update and render the whole scene twice for a single 3D frame. This second approach would kill the FPS.","files":null}]}
