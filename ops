Let's say you changed it to `/media/Daten/Programme/GaiaSky`. So, from now on, `GSDATA=/media/Daten/Programme/GaiaSky`.\n\nYou need to do the `tar -xzvf catalog-edr3-extralarge.tar.gz -C $GSDATA` so that it is extracted in the right place for Gaia Sky to see it. Note that there should be a descriptor file (`catalog-edr3-extralarge.json`) in the base directory `$GSDATA`.\n\nThe [data repository index page](https://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/gaiasky/files/repository/) contains the instructions to download and install packages manually.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"191644755d6473d7e56b764a220319044654a755"},"timestamp":1610703301,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"486221809"},"message":"Hi, thank you.
