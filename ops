Fixed in incoming commit.\n3. Yes, the object size, which in the case of stars is a bit fuzzy because we do not have an actual physical radius for most stars but still need to render them as models and need to know when to stop the camera. In the case of the sun it is around 6e5 Km\n4. If you teleport inside an object the object is not rendered, obviously, as all the triangles face outwards. This case is usually enforced by restrictions on the camera movements and the geometry of close by objects, but the setCameraPosition() method does not check this, as the number of objects can be arbitrarily large.","files":null}]}
