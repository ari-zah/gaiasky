As a workaround in the meantime, you can just run the ``gradlew desktop:dist`` command twice. That should work, as the version file is created in the first run (but not included in the jar for some obscure reason). In the second run the file is correctly included in the jar. I'll look into this when I have some time (and I'm back to work from holydays ;) ).\n\nAbout the second error, I do not maintain or use the ``createDeb`` target. I guess I created it to experiment with the base ``dpkg-deb`` command, but it might well be outdated.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1513865939,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"76472275"},"message":"*Created by: vga101*\n\nThanks for the information - fix on first error works and builds the respective release. Enjoy your holidays, merry Christmas, and please ignore my issues till you're back - just submitting so that I won't forget... ;-)","files":null}]}
