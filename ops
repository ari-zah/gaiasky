The `.gaiasky` folder contains mostly configuration files and I think it should stay in the user's home. Its size is negligible compared to the datasets. You can always symlink it to your installation folder and put the data there if you really wanna have it all in the same place. However, I will not add Windows-specific code or installation branches, as I think that config should be stored per-user, even if there's only one user in the system. Just a good practice in my opinion.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"23b42951fa2992964d0f6e6beb52911d02b3fb0c"},"timestamp":1611562360,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"492893975"},"message":"My main issue (in this case) was with the temp folder because it's located in the .gaiasky folder too. Even when the data folder have a different path, downloading stuff to it first goes through the temp folder and this operation takes a lot of space.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1611562424,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"492894710"},"message":"That is a valid point. I should probably move the temp folder into the data folder.","files":null}]}
