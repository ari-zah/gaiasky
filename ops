The method name has a type (Postion instead of Position), which may surprise users. Could this be corrected (breaks existing code) or a second, otherwise identical method added? I'd like to have only the corrected version in the REST API, which people might enter manually.\n\n2. The comment in `core/src/gaia/cu9/ari/gaiaorbit/script/IScriptingInterface.java` says that the camera position is in km, but it seems to be rather million km (checking when focusing the sun). \n\n3. When calling `setCameraPostion()` with double vector (3., 0., 0.), again focusing the sun, the GUI info panel (right bottom) shows \"Dist 2.4739E6 km\". What's the reason for the difference? Size of the object? The getDistanceTo(\"Sol\") method also returns \"2473896.0266113277\".\n\n4. Calling `setCamerPosition()` with double vector (0., 0., 0.), when focus is on the sun, the sun actually disappears. That's a bit odd, but being inside the object, I guess is not defined anyway, so this may need to be checked by the user code (script/REST).","files":null}]}
