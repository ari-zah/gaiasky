Of course, Snap is out of the question.\nI'm only familiar with flatpak and appimage at a (sporadic) user level, and I must say that I personally do not really like or use these packaging systems too much. I tend to prefer the distros' native way of doing things, but I can see that this provides benefits to some users and I won't oppose a PR bringing flatpak/appimage support. I can, of course, offer my help if needed. \n\nSince submission to flatpak only requires forking their app repo, adding the manifest files for the new app and creating a PR, the changes needed in this repo are —correct me if I'm wrong— pretty much zero. The data can be pulled from our [downloads page](http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/gaiasky/files/releases/) (unfortunately, this is still unencrypted HTTP, I'm pressing the server admin to migrate to HTTPS, which will hopefully happen before the end of the year).

Of course you can have a manifest here for development, but I assume it's not a big deal with Java to have all dependencies available foe the build. You could also add flatpak build to pipeline to ensure it works but nesting containerization tools is tricky.\n\nThe only thing of interest is [the metainfo file](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/metainfocreator/#/) which is not Flatpak/Flathub specific and holds general metadata used also by other Linux distributions/stores (including snap and appimage) if it's available.

I guess `libgnome` is not present in the flatpak environment?\n\nI have also seen that JOSM ends up calling [this function](https://github.com/openstreetmap/josm/blob/7ca90fa436678f64cbec26c69416d698a83d5b66/src/org/openstreetmap/josm/tools/PlatformHookUnixoid.java#L66), which, in one case, defaults to the same AWT `Desktop.browse()`, but it also has a couple of code paths that directly spawn a process (i.e. with `xdg-open`) through `Runtime.exec()`. There are some issues about this [here](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ticket/5629), [here](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ticket/5108) and [here](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ticket/9568). Maybe we could copy the fallback solution to directly spawn an `xdg-open` process if the AWT browse() does not work.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"2583c7da13f57a2c900a60dc098377d24a7700f5"},"timestamp":1600794451,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"416839387"},"message":"I was hoping for an answer besides just include xdg-open (that doesn't seem right to me), but that's what another suggested as well (https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/519).

Make the needed changes (see https://github.com/flathub/de.uni_heidelberg.zah.GaiaSky/pull/3). For many releases this will just be the new url and new sha256sum.  In this case I needed to bump the freedesktop sdk version too.\n2. I built it locally with:\nflatpak-builder build_dir/ de.uni_heidelberg.zah.GaiaSky/de.uni_heidelberg.zah.GaiaSky.yaml\nand installed via:\nflatpak-builder --user --install build-dir de.uni_heidelberg.zah.GaiaSky/de.uni_heidelberg.zah.GaiaSky.yaml\n3. Push the PR with the changes once it works.  The Flathub CI makes a build that can be installed.\n4. Confirm that build works fine.\n5. Merge the PR\n6. Flathub CI builds it again, once completed click publish button in the CI. ait a bit, then published :)\n\nI think for most releases, just the url and sha256sum need to change and that can all happen in GH/Flathub CI without locally building first.\n\n*EDIT*: Also need to edit de.uni_heidelberg.zah.GaiaSky.metainfo.xml and update this line - release version=\"3.0.0\" date=\"2020-12-02\" urgency=\"high\"","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1607680390,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"464852968"},"message":"Great!
