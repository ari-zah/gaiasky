Please describe.**\nYesterday I tried to download the full Gaia Sky catalogue from  the Download Manager. I'm using drive D as my Gaia Sky installation and data path because I use drive C only as an OS drive and it's almost full. Little did I know that Gaia Sky used its .gaiasky folder as a temporary storage for the downloads too... I run out of space faster than the speed of light.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nJust like Gaia Sky have the ability to change it's data folder from the Download Manager it would be nice if we can change the other folder locations too (including the settings of the program). Ideally, they would be part of the program installation folder.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nThis can be either included in the installation process (for Windows PC's) something like \"Install Gaia Sky for all users\" and \"Install Gaia Sky just for me\" or the easiest way - change the folders directly from the System tab where I believe they are currently listed in a similar way to changing the data folder (by clicking on the folder path).\n\nRegards,\nGeorgi","files":null}]}
