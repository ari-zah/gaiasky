The root cause seems to be the same as in #301, but I could never reproduce this locally.\nTo make Gaia Sky run again, edit the `[HOME_FOLDER]/.gaiasky/global.properties` file and set the following values:\n\n```\ngraphics.screen.fullscreen=false\ngraphics.screen.width=[desired width]\ngraphics.screen.height=[desired height]\n```\n\nChange [desired width] and [desired height] to the actual wanted window size. If these values come to be zero again, the app will fail to start. Try to remember exactly what you were doing before, that could help narrow this down. Other than that, a patch that checks window size values before persisting was submitted (023728c4) and will make it into the next release.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"05443c63ebcf2b99adda28565c9dbdbb66ab5cea"},"timestamp":1570558296,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"227646067"},"message":"Hi, thanks for the tip, but it didn't work.
