The star point of light becomes bigger and bigger.\n2. When it is close enough it starts to wobble a lot and suddenly it becomes smaller and transitions to the 3D model of the star.\n3. Sometimes at the distance at which this happens you can see a separate large point of light just behind the smaller 3D model at a certain angle.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe transitions from point to 3D model should be smooth and the one should eliminate the other.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nRight before the bug (still a 2D point):\n![before](/uploads/b647762cbd33d7e96963ab4a7e02990a/before.jpg)\n\nRight after the bug (small 3D model):\n![after](/uploads/c8c3e11530aceffd84e56503666bf5cb/after.jpg)\n\nBig point of light and a small 3D model at once:\n![weird](/uploads/dd8fdb03a88b5d786d75039f06e9fe25/weird.jpg)\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: [Windows 7 SP1 x64]\n - Graphics card [AMD Radeon R7 250]\n - OpenGL: 4.1.13587, GLSL: 4.60\n - Java: 11.09\n - Gaia Sky version 3.0.2]\n\nRegards,\nGeorgi","files":null}]}
