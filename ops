Since libgdx uses signed short indices, the maximum number of vertices/faces is 2^15. That number is rather low by today's standards, but it ensures compatibility with OpenGL ES. Each model is composed by a set of parts, and that restriction only applies within each part, so what I do is split the model into different parts in blender using a connectivity operator and if any of the parts exceeds the number of vertices or faces, apply a decimate operator to reduce the count.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1509575171,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"76472260"},"message":"*Created by: kevinjardine*\n\nOK thanks.
