Apparently, updating Gaia Sky only added new .jar files, but did not remove any old ones, and I suppose the old one was (at least sometimes) preferred to the new one when choosing which to use.\n\nI recognised the problem just by looking in the folder and seeing that there were lots of libraries with a different file date than those of the newest bunch. I only deleted those, though, that seemed to have an updated equivalent. Of course, the question is why I seem to be the only one to have this old-libs problem...\n\nUnfortunately, now that I'm able to start, startup also yields a crash (with a report), so I'm going to check if it matches any already reported.\n\nRemoved libraries:\n* gdx-1.9.8.jar\n* gdx-backend-lwjgl-1.9.8.jar\n* gdx-controllers-1.9.8.jar\n* gdx-controllers-desktop-1.9.8.jar\n* gdx-controllers-platform-1.9.8-natives-desktop.jar\n* gdx-platform-1.9.8-natives-desktop.jar\n* jcommander-1.64.jar\n* lwjgl-2.9.3.jar","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1566377576,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"206190405"},"message":"I'll check the installer and see if a clean install is possible instead of an update (which does not make sense, as every version is self-contained).\n**EDIT:** Just checked it and the installer runs the previous version's ununstaller (if a previous version is found), so my only guess is that something in the install process failed?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"48943e4dec1febfe85d32bb2e1e6059907c4952f"},"timestamp":1566422596,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"206537170"},"message":"Perhaps, though I don't remember seeing any error message.
