Since you already created a Debian package: how about uploading it to Debian? Then it would be automatically part of the distribution (as well as on Ubuntu, Mint etc.). We could help you getting through all the formalities needed to upload it.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me either personally, or via our [mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-astro/).\n\nBest regards\n\nOle","files":null}]}
