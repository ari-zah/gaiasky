Totally doable.\n\nThe **third** one could indeed be useful and is easy to implement, even though it would only work for objects which have a star ancestor in the scene graph, which is fine.\n\nThe **last** one. That's actually how the `goToObject()` function worked in the beginning, but since objects have vastly different sizes, it would often result in the camera being too close or to far away. That's why we changed it to work with the target view angle of the object. If using the distance is still needed, the angle can easily be worked out by using the `getObjectRadius(name)` and some trigonometry.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1506071155,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"76472235"},"message":"Just pushed a commit with the requested functions, let me know if you find any issues.","files":null}]}
