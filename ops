Love to read the documentation about the features... \nI want also to give the compliment for this great space simulator software. It is far more better than others I have tried. I hope that the community will grow!

I would suggest using the [STIL loader](http://gaia-sky.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Data-catalogs-formats.html#stil-data-provider), as it accepts VOTable, FITS, CSV, etc. You can also use SAMP to get data in Gaia Sky from Topcat or Aladin since a few commits ago, so there's that.\n\nAlso, thanks for the offering, but there is no way to donate to the project.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1520518423,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"76472325"},"message":"Can I close the issue?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1520518847,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"76472326"},"message":"*Created by: RED29*\n\nOk clear answer.
