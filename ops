Please describe.**\n\nCurrently Gaia Sky already supports quite a few different catalogues which are not related to the stars like clusters, galaxies and nebulae. Although the scope of the program is not to simulate the entire Universe (which will be awesome), I think that a nice addition to the current content will be the inclusion of all known exoplanets in the Milky Way. I'm not familiar with the inner workings of the program but basically this needs a few things:\n1. A catalogue (the link is down below).\n2. 3D models of the planets (the existing ones could be used as a start).\n3. Textures (I can try to do this part even though I never did this before).\n4. ...?\n\nIs it possible though and how to integrate the new planets to their host stars because Gaia Sky already have quite a few star catalogues and in a perfect world they should have some kind of dependency resolution in place?\n\n**Additional context**\nHere is the repository of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue: https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/open_exoplanet_catalogue/\n\nPS: I would be glad to help you with this if the whole idea is feasible, however I'm clueless at programming...\n\nRegards,\nGeorgi","files":null}]}
