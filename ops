You should never do that, as they are different cuts of the same catalog. If you want all stars, use only the `dr2-extralarge` catalog. Run `gaiasky.exe -c` to choose the catalogs at startup. See [this question in the FAQ](http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/gaiasky/docs/html/latest/FAQ.html#q-why-so-many-dr2-catalogs).\n\nAlso, the default heap space on windows is 4 GB.
