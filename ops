The macOS version `3.0.2` is not built against the `3.0.2` tag (9bd17f001), it was patched afterwards due to a problem with a system library in the controllers backend. The macOS `3.0.2` is actually 48034a562, so use this version (or the master) and it will work.\n\nAbout `--safemode` not working, it is because the `gaiasky` script in the directory is just a convenient wrapper around gradlew, which does not communicate all the arguments to gradlew. If you really really need safe mode, you can build the application (`gradlew core:dist`) and then run it from the `releases/` folder. But the whole point of safe mode is that it activates automatically when OpenGL 4.x does not work. In your case, it will work without it.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"bb3066a047f32e7396f7a758ed1a5f54327e5be0"},"timestamp":1611280813,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"491275194"},"message":"That seemed to be the issue.

Watching the launch output earlier this morning I did notice that safemode was getting triggered anyways once a decent OpenGL option couldn't be located.","files":null}]}
