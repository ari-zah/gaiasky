This means no 3D textures, no occlusion queries, no compute, geometry and tessellation shaders, and basically no modern features (OpenGL 3+/4+) at all. We're currently stuck with whatever is supported in OpenGL ES and WebGL. We need to **strip all this infrastructure** and create a single project which has access to the raw OpenGL API through lwjgl.\n\nGaia Sky will not be gettin any new android or webgl versions anytime soon.","files":null}]}
