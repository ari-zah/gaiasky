This would allow for more realistic lighting scenes in, for example, Saturn and its rings, or in satellites which have complex models (self shadows). If the render-as-model threshold is low enough, we could even see eclipses as the shadow of the Moon projected on Earth. \nSome fundamental changes should be made in the current shaders and rendering pipeline, so this is expected to take some good work.","files":null}]}
