However, some kind of fix is very much appreciated in order to work in planetarium and panorama mode. \n\nSince star brightness and size can be changed by the user one could find a reasonable solution by experimenting. However, the constellation lines, the coordinate lines and the orbit lines become thinner and thinner and cannot be changed in the current version. Would it be possible to manually or by a script change the line width. This would already help a lot!","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1579177301,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"272511253"},"message":"Line width factor control added to configuration, UI and API call in 600d2218b.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1580472640,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"280071790"},"message":"Solution based on empirical fits commited to master.
