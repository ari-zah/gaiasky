The ability to run scripts in a synchronous manner is implemented though, see [here](https://github.com/langurmonkey/gaiasky/blob/master/desktop/src/gaia/cu9/ari/gaiaorbit/script/JythonFactory.java#L93). Basically, what changes is that if ``async`` is on, the script is run in its own thread. Otherwise, the script is run inline in the main thread.\nThis is just a warning indicating that the function will probably cause problems if the script that calls it is run synchronously.","files":null}]}
