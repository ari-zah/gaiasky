I'm in no way a programmer, but I'm almost certain it's because of my OS, I just want to make sure is a fault on my end and not the program's error, and/or maybe see if there's a way to get it running that doesn't involve rebuilding the program.\n\nHere's the .zip I made with all the information I could get:\n\n[Bug_Report.zip](/uploads/d5290b6126cb4a9645761b6eab73462f/Bug_Report.zip)\n\nThanks in advance!","files":null}]}
