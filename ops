The linear velocity approximation of proper motions just does not make sense with such long times; orbits should be integrated around the galaxy assuming a galactic potential model.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"96b0ca7cd30bb493310f134fed311141138b4461"},"timestamp":1525859202,"metadata":{"gitlab-id":"76472302"},"message":"*Created by: RED29*\n\nI completely understand why it makes sense that there is a limit. I was using for a instruction to show the motion of the galaxy in terms of x years. If you move speed forward in time, our galaxy is not a static view but a place full of motion. Maybe I can make a video for that.","files":null}]}
