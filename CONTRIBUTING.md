# Contributing to Gaia Sky

First of all, thanks for reading this! It means you are considering to contribute to Gaia Sky, which is appreciated.

## How to contribute

There are several ways to contribute to the Gaia Sky project:

### Pull requests and source code

Start by checking the official docs ([here](https://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/gaiasky/docs/html/latest)) to get acquainted with the project. It may also help decide what part you want to contribute to. Pull requests should be accompanied with extensive and comprehensive comments. In case that changes in the documentations are needed, they should be also part of the pull request (folder [/docs](docs)).

Pull requests should never contain configuration files unless totally necessary (do not commit your `conf/global.properties`). Also, make sure that the project compiles and all the dependencies are well specified in the `build.gradle`. 

The code style format is available in the root of the project, [eclipse-formatter.xml](eclipse-formatter.xml).

### Commit message format

Gaia Sky adheres to a standard commit message format that should be kept in order to generate meaningful changelogs:

```
<type>: <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Commit message example:

```
feat: adds relativistic camera mode

Add relativistic camera mode which makes use of the already implemented relativistic aberration and gravitational wave model.

Fixes #123
```

#### type

-  **feat**: new feature
-  **fix**: bug fix, should possibly reference the issue id in footer
-  **docs**: changes to the documentation
-  **style**: changes that don't affect functionality or such as cosmetic changes or formatting
-  **refactor**: code refactorings which do not modify functionality or fix a bug, class changes, name changes, moves, etc.
-  **perf**: changes that improve performance
-  **build**: changes to the build and continuous integration systems
-  **none**: minor changes that will not appear in the changelog

#### subject

Contains a condensed description of the change. Uses imperative present tense (change and add instead of changes/changed or adds/added). It shouldn't be capitalized and without a period at the end.

#### body

Thorough description of the change. You can elaborate at will. Not required.

#### footer

Cites any issues that the commit closes. Not required.


### Bug reports and requests

Issues are the way to go.

If reporting bugs and crashes, provide a report as extensive as possible, including (if applicable):

- A description of the problem
- How to reproduce
- Your system (CPU, RAM, GPU, OS, OS version, graphics drivers version, etc.)
- A stack trace if applicable.

A stack trace can be obtained by simply copy-pasting the contents of the terminal window (if launched from terminal) or in the installation folder, files `output.log` and `error.log`, if launched using any of the packaged versions.

### Translations

Right now we have translation files for Bulgarian, English (UK and US), German, French, Catalan, Spanish and Slovenian. Some are incomplete (especially French, Solvenian and German) so they might benefit from a check up. Adding new translations is as easy as submitting a pull request. Translation files should go in the [i18n](assets/i18n) folder.
First, copy the default [gsbundle.properties](assets/i18n/gsbundle.properties) file and use it as a template. The translation files must have the format:

`gsbundle_<language_code>[<_country_code>].properties`

### Data

Contributing data files is always welcome. Have a look at the current data files in the [data](assets/data) folder, most of them should be pretty self-explanatory. Also, you might want to have a look at the documentation on [data files and format](https://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/gaiasky/docs/html/latest/Data-catalogs-formats.html).
