Replace the \"Welcome to\" string with \"Добре дошли в\" in the Welcome screen section in the gsbundle properties file (I created my own file with bg_BG to obey the standards).\n2. Run Gaia Sky with the modified locale file.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe font should display correctly any cyrillic characters.\n\n**Screenshots**\n![font](/uploads/316074260bd35a94a79a4e0186fb09bf/font.png)\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - Gaia Sky version [3.0.2]\n\n**Additional context**\nBy the way, I'm in love with this fonts, this is a very nice selection (looks like every other font works so far).\n\nRegards,\nGeorgi","files":null}]}
