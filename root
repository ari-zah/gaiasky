The idea is to move all the functionality associated to star catalogs, that is\n\n- Rendering based on magnitude and color\n- Selection and focusing\n- Labels\n- Close-up shading\n- Star models\n- Light glow\n- Indexing by names and several IDs\n- Proper motion vectors\n- Constellations\n\nto a more GPU-based approach. Right now, each star gets a model object in the system memory and at each cycle all stars must be visited and updated (floating camera, view angles, etc.). This drastically limits the number of stars that we can represent on screen at once. The new approach would basically move the raw rendering to the GPU using VBO+shaders. The rest of the functionality can be implemented using a fast sort by visual angle happening on a background thread and using the visually larger stars to limit the processing of labels, proper motions, etc.\nThis is gonna be a huge enhancement in performance terms.","files":null}]}
