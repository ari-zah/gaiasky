It does work in VR mode, but there's a few things to do to make to a really immersive experience.\n\nYou are not applying the correct distortion or chromatic effects which make the HMD and lens combination compatible with the human visual system so it looks quite bad away from the centre of the FOV.\n\nThere is also no head-tracking, which makes it a little nauseating after a while.\n\nYou might want to automatically disable the UI when in VR mode as they are pretty useless with the Oculus RIft, it simply does not have the resolution to support such small text and having them in the edges and corners makes it impossible to read anyway, not to mention quite immersion breaking.\n\nBrad Smith has a java binding to the Oculus Rift libraries:\n\nhttps://github.com/jherico/jovr\n\nwhich does not make these problems impossible to solve!\nWhich should enough to implement","files":null}]}
