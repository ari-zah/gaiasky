I'm always frustrated when...**\n\nExample current work flows:\n\n1.  select single object in gaiasky via CTRL-F and then enter the DR2 or HIP identifier,\n\n       *however, currently there is not a way to easily 'click to add object to a project favorites list'*\n\ne.g. if I want to create a list of all nearby stars with exoplanets, or a list of key stars Gaia DR2 has measured in various globular clusters to study repeatedly or to share with others.\n\n2.  Press HOME to return to Earth in gaiasky, THEN select object in ALADIN which sends RA \u0026 DEC coordinates to \u0026 orients gaiasky in the correct direction so can use mouse scroll towards the object\n\n       *however, that currently does not directly select the desired object...is this possible with SAMP?*\n\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\n1. a clickable add to favorites 'star' in the current clickable \"Gaia Simbad Wikipedia\" line (basic idea example scribbled in pink on one screenshot in the album below)\n\n2. \u0026 a pop up menu where I can organize the favorites, import/export/share, the 'favorites' selected by the above process into a user created tree of lists. In the following drop down menu I have made an example from a start of some lists I might create for myself with such a feature.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n  \u003csummary\u003eDrop menu of brief examples of user created sorted 'favorites' lists:\u003c/summary\u003e\n    \n  ```\n*  Exoplanets [FOLDER]:\n*        Close2Sun [LIST]\n*            Proxima Cen     [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*            Alpha Cen B     [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*            Barnard's Star  [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*            Tau Cet         [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*            Trappist1       [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*        Mstar [LIST]\n*            Barnard's Star  [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*            Trappist1       [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*        Kstar [LIST]\n*            Alpha Cen B     [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*        Gstar [LIST]\n*            Tau Cet         [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*            Alpha Cen A     [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n\n*  GlobularClusterStars [FOLDER]:\n*            NGC7078 [LIST]\n*                1745949255741888256 [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*            NGC7099 [LIST]\n*                6816581907318080640 [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*                6816581804238781184 [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*                6816581903023698560 [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*                6816581151405484160 [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*  StudyOpenClusters [FOLDER]:\n*            Pleiades [LIST]\n*                Alcyone [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n*            Hyades [LIST]\n*                HIP 20894 [A SELECTABLE VIA CLICK 'favorite' entry]\n  ```\n  \n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n3. \u0026 If SAMP/aladin/gaiasky can some way send/process an object ID rather than RA \u0026 DEC, I would find it very useful/efficient to be able to click on an object in aladin \u0026 have that same object automatically selected in gaiasky as this would make finding the object so much easier than just being pointed in the correct direction from Earth via the RA \u0026 Dec that is currently passed from aladin to gaiadky via SAMP. (I could not spot a way to already configure 'send object ID' rather than 'send RA DEC', but if there is then please let me know :-)\n\n**Additional context**\n\n*  Here is a link to an album with some relevant screenshots: https://photos.app.goo.gl/xwAkdr9wcf9hvkaq8\n\nThank you for considering something like this concept.","files":null}]}
