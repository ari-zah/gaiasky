This will become absolutely necessary when we go to catalogs with higher star count (GDR2 ~ hundreds of millions of stars).\nFor that a new octree generator and loader need to be implemented so that the octree is actually distributed in multiple files. The loader will have a background thread which will receive data requests to load certain pages.","files":null}]}
