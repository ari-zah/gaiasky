Earth at (0,0,0), positive x-axis pointing to galactic centre, positive z axis pointing to north galactic pole. Values in parsecs.\n\nOr at least a utility function to convert galactic cartesian coordinates to the ones used by the setCameraPosition function in the scripting package.","files":null}]}
