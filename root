This is not a problem in a language like English but when using a language such as Bulgarian with longer words and more complex grammatical rules this becomes evident. I observed this behaviour with a few buttons and I tried to mitigate the effect through translation but this is not possible everywhere.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe size of the buttons should adjust itself in reference to the string length.\n\n**Screenshots**\n![Untitled](/uploads/1c82df0013bd76c7f0919cd138143e9c/Untitled.png)\n\n**Additional context**\nAlso, I would like to know if there are any more unused strings in the translation files? I tried hard to locate where are those strings in the program (which I want to translate) but I'm unable to find them and without seeing visually what they do I'm quite in a struggle to translate them accurately. For example the ones in # Data tab: \"title\", \"default\", \"always\", \"never\" and the ones in # Dataset load dialog.\n\nRegards,\nGeorgi","files":null}]}
